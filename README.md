# Chest Cancer Detection With Chest CT-Scan 🩺💻📈

Chest cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection of chest cancer is crucial for successful treatment and better patient outcomes. Chest CT-scans are an important tool for diagnosing chest cancer, but the process of analyzing CT-scans can be time-consuming and require specialized medical expertise. 

To address this challenge, I have developed a deep learning-based system for detecting chest cancer using chest CT-scans. The system uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images and identify potential cancerous lesions in the chest. By automating the analysis process, our system can help healthcare professionals make faster and more accurate diagnoses, potentially saving lives. 💪🔬💊 

## Dataset 📊

I used the [Chest CT-Scan Images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images) from Kaggle, which contains 1000 CT-scans of the chest, labeled as either normal or 3 type of cancerous lesions. The images in the dataset have varying resolutions, so I preprocessed them to ensure they were all the same size. 📈📉📊
